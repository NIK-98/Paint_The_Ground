Example of custom License in folders: res://example/license_example.txt | res://example/eula.txt res://example/license_example.uc

In any other folder other than addons, Licenses handler as {Base Licenses}: Nothing special, just a disclaimer in case of using external software or code,
otherwise they are handled as third-party licenses.
